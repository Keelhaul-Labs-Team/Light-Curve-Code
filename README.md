# Light-Curve-Code

Hello @everyone!. This code has been created to process each frame of a video, measure the percentage of brightness in each frame, save the data in a row matrix and then graph it for visualization.

"Currently, there is no conventional formula for brightness calculation, and the same image-processing tool may employ several different brightness measures. However, stimuli, equibright according to one measure, may differ more, than ten times according to another." [1]
